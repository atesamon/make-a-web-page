  <p> ACCORDING TO ANDY's NOTES:</p>
  <h2>Lesson: 1.1</h2>
  <div class="lesson">

  <p> www:Computer that communicate with each other </p>
 <p>How the web works: "When a person goes to a web page like www.google.com, their computer sends a HTTP Request to a server. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer where a web browser interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen</p>
  <p>HTML: "Hypertext Markup Language"</p>
  <p>HTML documents contain text content which describes "what you see" and markup which describes "how it looks", references to other documents and links to other pages</p>
  <p> Tags and Elements: HTML documents are made of HTML elements. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML tags.</p>
  <p>Inline vs Block Elements:HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box" around the content inside of them. Eg: Inline: br;b;em;img. Block: p.</p>
  </div>
  <h3>Lesson 1.2</h3>
 <div class="lesson">
<p>The "tree-like structure" of HTML:he "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them.  
    <p> Text Editors: Programmers use text editors sush as Sublime Text or Codepen.</p>
  </div>
  
    <h4>Lesson 1.3<h4>
     <div class="lesson"> 
      <p> CSS: Cascading Style sheets (cascading: most specific rule) </p>
      <p> To place a comment: /* comment */ </p>
      <p> Box Sizing: Html elements are boxes and each box has 4 components (magin,border,padding and content); there are 2 techniques so you can use to helpdeal with sizing issues:1) set sizes in terms of percentages rather than pixels.2) Set the box sizing attribute to border box for every element. 3) Different brwsers work slightly differently sometimes this causes different browsers to display the same code differently.</p>
      <p>Box Positioning: 1)Divs are blocks elements (as opposed to inline) so by default they take up the entire widht of a page. 2) Adding the rule (display: flex;)  to the appropiate CSS will override this behavior and let divs appear next to each other.</p>
      <p> Code, Test, Refine: 1) look for natural boxes; 2) look for repeated styles and semantic elements; 3) write your html; 4) apply styles (from biggest to smallest); 5) fix things.</p>
